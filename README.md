# RandomPasswordGenerator
Randomly generate password
This project is to randomly generate passowords. I set up the password length between 8 and 128 letters. You can choose to include one or more character types such as lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters. I tried to make all kinds of combinations to work, should you decide to choose two or more input types. 
Here is the screenshots for your reference.
